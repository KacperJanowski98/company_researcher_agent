# Company Researcher Agent

A specialized tool that acts like a digital detective for businesses. You give it a company name and tell it exactly what details you want (using a JSON template as a blueprint). It then scours the internet, gathering those specific pieces of information and delivers them back to you in a neatly organized format that matches your template.
